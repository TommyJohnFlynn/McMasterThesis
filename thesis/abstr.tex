Model-based clustering is the use of finite mixture models to identify underlying group structures in data. Estimating parameters for mixture models is notoriously difficult, with the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm being the predominant method. An alternative approach is the evolutionary algorithm (EA) which emulates natural selection on a population of candidate solutions. By leveraging a fitness function and genetic operators like crossover and mutation, EAs offer a distinct way to search the likelihood surface. EAs have been developed for model-based clustering in the multivariate setting; however, there is a growing interest in matrix-variate distributions for three-way data applications. In this context, we propose an EA for finite mixtures of matrix-variate distributions.
