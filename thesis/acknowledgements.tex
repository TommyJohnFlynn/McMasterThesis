\prefacesection{Acknowledgements}

First I would like thank my supervisor, Dr. Paul McNicholas, for his guidance into the world of model-based clustering. 

I would also like to thank Dr. Noah Forman and Dr. Ben Bolker for serving as members of my examining committee.

Lastly, I would like to thank my friends and family for their endless support over my 6-year journey at McMaser University. I could not have done it without them.
